      <description>Introduction The Sharpe Ratio is a way of evaluating the value of an investment after subtracting for its risk. In this project we&amp;rsquo;ll use it to compare four stocks: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, and Tesla. We&amp;rsquo;ll be using the S&amp;amp;P 500 to measure the overall volatility of the market.
Getting started To start, we&amp;rsquo;ll load in the data which was pulled from Yahoo Finance. To account for the recent recession the data begins with the start of the current business cycle in early March.</description>

It could also optimize navigation apps ability to suggest alternate routes.</description>
