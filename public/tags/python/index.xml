      <description>Introduction The Sharpe Ratio is a way of evaluating the value of an investment after subtracting for its risk. In this project we&amp;rsquo;ll use it to compare four stocks: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, and Tesla. We&amp;rsquo;ll be using the S&amp;amp;P 500 to measure the overall volatility of the market.
Getting started To start, we&amp;rsquo;ll load in the data which was pulled from Yahoo Finance. To account for the recent recession the data begins with the start of the current business cycle in early March.</description>

      <description>Introduction For my capstone project as part of IBM&amp;rsquo;s Professional Certificate in Data Science I created a machine learning model that would predict the severity of a car accident based off of the lighting conditions, road conditions, and weather. This project has many practical uses. Being able to better predict how severe an accident is enables emergency services to more effectively triage in cases of multiple accidents. It could also optimize navigation apps ability to suggest alternate routes.</description>
